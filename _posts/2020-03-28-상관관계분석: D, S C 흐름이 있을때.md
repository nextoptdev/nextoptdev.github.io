```
find i for
 D ~ [D's trend, D's season, y_S_shift(i)]
``` 
```python
df.epsilon = df.y - m.predict(df)['yhat']
```

for this we suggest the following
1. `sort corr(df.epsilon, y_S_shift(i))`
2. `select a number of i who have high correlation.`
3. `feature candidate : {y_S_shift(i)}`

The reason behind comparing the error (\\( y - \widehat{y} \\)) and y_S, instead of y_D and y_S, is to eliminate the effect of highered correlation resulting from the same seasonality components.
